## Description
This work investigates the impact of Near-Real-Time Radio Access Network (RAN) Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC) deployment on cloud-hosted 6G networks, contributing to operational efficiencies and cost-effectiveness of RAN management. We discuss the integration of Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), and cloud-native technologies in Open RAN (O-RAN) architectures, with a focus on Near-RT RIC for time-sensitive operations. In our contributions, we present an optimization model to solve the disaggregated near-RT RIC placement problem considering a cloud-native infrastructure to minimize the placement cost while satisfying the latency-sensitive control loop requirements across the cloud-edge spectrum. Moreover, we introduce an experimental environment using distinct geographically disparate cloud sites and present a comprehensive dataset detailing the link communication latencies of the data center and the costs of real-world network topology. We conduct a thorough performance evaluation of Near-RT RIC deployment, evaluating the positioning cost, the deployment and registration times, and the control loop latency in three scenarios. Our results show that in a cloud-native environment, the disaggregated Near-RT RIC allows cost savings of up to 60\%, and we evaluate the feasibility of disaggregated positioning in practice using a real-world cloud computing infrastructure.

It is a pleasure to share our knowledge, and you are free to use it! Please, cite our work as we can continue contributing. Thank you!
